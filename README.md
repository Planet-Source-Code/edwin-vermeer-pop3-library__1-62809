### Description

This is a library for accessing a pop3 email box.

With this library you will be able to:

* Access any pop3 email box (if your network allows it)

* See what is in that mailbox (number of emails and sizes, etc.).

* Read the emails and delete them if you want to.

* Read all properties of an email.

* Handele Attachments

See the screenshot for most of the options that are available.

I am also working on a WebMail application that is using this library. It's for 80% finished. You can take a peek at it at http://www.evict.nl/open_source.asp

The TCP/IP communication is don by using the Generic Client object from the submition that I did earlier this week.

If you need a simple demo how this works, then have a look at http://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=62794&amp;lngWId=1

For testing purposes I have set up a test email account. This way the demo works without changing parameters. You can even send a test mail to that mail box. Don't over do it. There is a size limit on the box. If it's abused then i will just close the account.
